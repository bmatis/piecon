# PieCon
Source code for a complete re-write of the www.piecon.com game convention website.

## About
PieCon is a small, private, annual gaming ~~convention~~ event on the Central Coast of California. A weekend long chance for friends to get together and game (tabletop RPGs, board games, LARPS, etc.) while eating pie. The website provides information for attendees and a place for everyone to announce what games they'll run and what pies (or other snacks) they'll bring.

Unlike the old PHP-based spaghetti code version currently in use, this version is a Python, Django & Bootstrap based re-write, which enables the following major improvements:

* Account creation
* Ability for attendees to edit the games and pies they're bringing
* Mobile responsiveness
* Fixed position site navigation bar
* Admin tool
* Unit tests!
